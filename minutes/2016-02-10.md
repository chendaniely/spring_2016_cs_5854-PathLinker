## Ideas for PathLinker 2.0

### Problem

#### Improve recall

There are edges that PathLinker picks up that are not within the known pathway.
Need a means to reduce the number of returned pathways (i.e. prune back the graph).

Evaluating multiple pathways requires:

- precision recall for each pathway
- precision recall for each reconstruction

One way to improve the algorithm is to follow how RandomForrests work
by running multiple stochastic runs of PL and order final set of edges.

### Algorithm

- Get all edges in the interactome.
- For those edges that we know are in the pathway, we increase the weight (e.g. 1).
- For those edges that we know are not in the pathway, we decrease the weight (e.g., 0.05).
- Run PathLinker

## Action
Get master script and modify it so the current PathLinker code will run
