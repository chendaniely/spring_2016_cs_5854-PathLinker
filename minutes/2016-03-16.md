- we only get good precision-recall curves when we:
  - sample negatives
  - ignore the edges

What we should try next:
  - do not ignore adjacents and do not subsample
  - aggregate all pathways
  - re-read supplementary to get CV method

Note: negativs in CV folds are known.

New algorithims:
  - semi-supervised learning
