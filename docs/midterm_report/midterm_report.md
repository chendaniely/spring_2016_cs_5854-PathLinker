# motivation

## what is the goal
We seek to develop a computational method to automatically construct signaling pathways using both a background interactome and incomplete information of the targeted pathway through manual curation.  Ideally this method should outperform similar techniques which utilize only the background interactome without the manually curated information.

# background
Signaling pathways are a fundamental aspect of systems biology, they control how a cell responds to external stimuli and ultimately what genes are expressed.  Understanding these complex systems guides what future biological experiments will be most informative, and also suggests potential pharmaceutical targets.  There exist multiple databases which store cellular interactions, but curating these interactions into meaningful pathways has traditionally been a costly manual process.  


## why are you doing it
While predicting pathways, we've previously only considered the confidence that an interaction takes place through experimental means.  Edge weights become more informative when we not only consider the confidence of the interaction, but whether it has been already currated manually in our pathway of interest.
